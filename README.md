**CHANGES**
  -Removed *most* unnecessary files in other folders.

  -Initialized the $digitorium as an $experience object.
  -Initialized *most* attributes for $digitorium.
  -Replaced some Work Experience information for the first position

**KNOWN ISSUES**
  -In the set_achievement function inside the $experience object, does not recognize the $achievemets_array as an array. This particular issue is causing errors in the display fields for their correlated outputs 
   (get_achievement output)
